## üìä Modeling Performance Insight:

I have run a total of 3 models:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Neural Network

The results in all 3 models show at least 80% accuracy. However, the Random Forest model seems to be overfitting, as the training score is 99%, while the testing score is 85%.
